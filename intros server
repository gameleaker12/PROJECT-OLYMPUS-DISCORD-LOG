BlueMoonStories - 06/22/2017
Hello, I am BlueMoonStories, AKA TheFieryPhoenixTV. You can call me by either names. I am the person kind of in charge of this whole thing as I am the one who initially proposed the idea. I will contribute work by developing a main storyline for the player to follow and also working to help manage the project. I will also be in charge of trying to figure out payment terms as well  as some other things here and there.
