Can you copy the emails to the group one so we can see?
Jakko - Last Monday at 7:59 PM
I'll post a screenshot in a second
Child of Hades - Last Monday at 8:01 PM
Okay
Jakko - Last Monday at 8:04 PM

He saw the post I sent
I don;t think it's BlueMoon or Wanheda. He must've been online for a split few seconds.(edited)
Child of Hades - Last Monday at 9:18 PM
Ask them how they got to our chat and why they're leaking stuff
Is it okay if I make a post on GD amino to ask about this? I'm sure they'd be able to help

Not me

Alright, I was hoping to avoid doing this, but we're going to have to change some things around in order to ensure this doesn't happen again.
Child of Hades - Last Tuesday at 9:41 AM
Yeah, definitely
Jakko - Last Tuesday at 4:16 PM
I'll ask him in just a second
Child of Hades - Last Tuesday at 9:03 PM
Is it okay if I make a post to ask for help with our "situation"?(edited)

Present!
I'm a little late
Sorry
Child of Hades - Today at 5:56 PM
It's fine. It's summer so people are out
Pedro87 - Today at 5:56 PM
Yeah
It was kind of busy these days
Child of Hades - Today at 5:56 PM
I asked about our situation on gd amino and so far have gotten nothing. They don't know
Pedro87 - Today at 5:57 PM
But the point is... I'm back to help!
So...
What's happening?
Child of Hades - Today at 6:03 PM
Our chat logs were leaked
We don't know who did it though
It's kind of creepy
Pedro87 - Today at 6:39 PM
Crap
Why would anyone here do that?
Child of Hades - Today at 6:49 PM
I have no idea. It was so random
Jakko - Today at 6:51 PM
He has updated it a little
Child of Hades - Today at 6:51 PM
Really? I'm gonna check it out
Jakko - Today at 6:52 PM
ok
Child of Hades - Today at 6:53 PM
This is so dam annoying!
Jakko - Today at 6:54 PM
Let's see if he adds a ransom file or something
Child of Hades - Today at 6:54 PM
One says "try to stop me" followed by evil laughter
Jakko - Today at 6:55 PM
hmmm
I'll go look
"You don't know who I am.
You obviously don't want me to leak more." is the only text in the try to stop me file
Child of Hades - Today at 6:57 PM
He's changing it, reading it now(edited)
Probably set their profile to offline mode
Jakko - Today at 6:58 PM
probably
I'll be back later
Child of Hades - Today at 7:00 PM
Ok
Pedro87 - Today at 7:02 PM
Ok
NEW MESSAGES
Pedro87 - Today at 7:02 PM
This guy is an idiot who has nothing to do
Child of Hades - Today at 7:02 PM
Definitely
Pedro87 - Today at 7:02 PM
I'll keep an eye on what he upgrades too
