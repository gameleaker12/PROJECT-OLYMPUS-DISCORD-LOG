It's also possible to run it from the browser.

It's fine now anyway.

Just did this sketch of a loading screen for Camp Half-Blood.
Of course I can make more for CHB AND other camps.
Child of Hades - 06/22/2017
It'd be cool to have a different loading screen for wherever you are. That for at chb, a tower for in the city, etc

23kashsuha - 06/23/2017
But this is good for now
Edelgris - 06/23/2017
How many abilities should each demigod-type have?
Child of Hades - 06/23/2017
Maybe one basic ability, two usual abilities, and a special one
Edelgris - 06/23/2017
what's the difference between basic and usual?
Child of Hades - 06/23/2017
Basic is like "I can run faster!" And usual would be "I can move water"
So extra human like abilities and then extra demigod abilities
Edelgris - 06/23/2017
Okay, thanks.
BlueMoonStories - 06/23/2017
Think of it like Mass Effect. You start with the basic abilities and as you level up you can either enhance the abilities you already have or unlock new ones once available
23kashsuha - 06/23/2017
For example, for a child of Hermes, what would those ablities be?
Child of Hades - 06/23/2017
Lock picking
Stealth
Speed
Believable lying
23kashsuha - 06/23/2017
Oh thanks, I didn't really think of any other powers than stealing
Child of Hades - 06/23/2017
Had anyone started making concept art?
I can do some depending on what type of style we want
BlueMoonStories - 06/23/2017
I think we should aim for a realism approach
I dunno if we'll get Witcher quality
but something along those lines hopefully
We should also consider game titles.
Maybe like Olympus : A Percy Jackson RPG or something
Child of Hades - 06/23/2017
For a title I was just thinking of something like "Halfbloods" and then say it's based on the books
BlueMoonStories - 06/23/2017
Or we could take the main story, if we are indeed doing Tartarus and call it The Depths of Tartarus: A Percy Jackson RPG or something
Something to really catch the gaming community's attention
Child of Hades - 06/23/2017
It's not just the main story though. A big portion of the game is training and hanging out with campers. We could give quests names though
BlueMoonStories - 06/23/2017
Or maybe try something in the style of Rick Riordan's tites
they are usually three words and start with The
Like The Lightning Thief, The Last Olympian
Maybe The Child of Olympus or something
The Demigod Adventures?
Child of Hades - 06/23/2017
The children of Olympus?
BlueMoonStories - 06/23/2017
Maybe
What do you guys think of this as maybe a cover art?

I was thinking orange since it's the color of the Half-Blood shirts
It's very basic but something of a design I guess
Child of Hades - 06/23/2017
I like it except for the font. Something about it seems off
BlueMoonStories - 06/23/2017
Yeah I'll mess with font a bit
I think I got it :smile:

Better?
Child of Hades - 06/23/2017
Y E S
perfect!
BlueMoonStories - 06/23/2017
if only we could get John Rocco to make a cover
that would be cool
He does the cover art for the Percy Jackson books
Child of Hades - 06/23/2017
Maybe when we mail to Rick we can ask something like that. I'll put it in the ideas file
BlueMoonStories - 06/23/2017
Maybe
I really hopes this works out lol. It would make me so happy as well as a lot of other people
Child of Hades - 06/23/2017
Me too...
BlueMoonStories - 06/23/2017
Well if we can get more people and everyone puts all of their best efforts into the game and we can negotiate with Riordan and Fox to allow us to make this game, then it'll work really really well
Child of Hades - 06/23/2017
We could always make a petition to let fox sell their rights to the franchise
June 24, 2017
23kashsuha - 06/24/2017
The cover art is perfect!
Child of Hades - 06/24/2017
So has anyone actually started coding anything out figured out how to start the coding?
BlueMoonStories - 06/24/2017
I don't know anything about coding so no
Is there anyone here currently who knows a decent amount about coding a video game?
Because while story and art is great, we will need people coding otherwise it's not going to mean anything.
Pedro87 - 06/24/2017
I don't know anything about it but I can talk to someone who knows
You can do this too
June 25, 2017
Edelgris - 06/25/2017
Should there not be certain abilities which are rare to get? I know it makes sense from a lore perspective, but I think it'll be a good portion of players who restarts the game again and again to get the "rare" ability. If we ever are going to introduce multiplayer it wouldn(edited)
't work well that someone got lucky and had an ability that none of the others of the same "class" had.
BlueMoonStories - 06/25/2017
Darkness ascends as lightness dies
An abyss of torture is where Tartarus lies
Few heroes shall survive their blows
Before the summer solstice, the demigod must go
Yet loved and loyal are important to know
Is the new prophecy
So I think there will be a calendar in game and once it reaches a certain day, they must go to Tartarus no matter what
They can spend their days however they want, building relationships, training, or whatever, but once they reach a week before the Summer Solstice or something they must go and choose two demigods to go with them.
Element - 06/25/2017
sounds good
Pedro87 - 06/25/2017
Nice!
Child of Hades - 06/25/2017
It's been recommended top me on gd amino that blender 3D will work for what we need so any programmers should download that now and try it out
June 26, 2017
S P A C E D A D - 06/26/2017
I don't have computer access right now ^^
One thing I would like to point out that caught my eye, before I type all my other thoughts again. I'm familiar with hosting multiplayer servers, and I'll tell you right now that we won't be able to do multiplayer on a large scale. If we get the game out there maybe on itch, maybe on steam, we most likely will have hundreds of players playing. Minecraft is a fairly simple game, and hosting a server of 10 at a very basic level pushes my computer close to the breaking point. My computer is not beefy. My brothers could probably host 20-25 on their beefy computers. To host multiplayer we would need to either build or buy a server computer if we wanted people to play across the world. We also would need someone with insane internet to host it. The only work around would be local multiplayer, with maybe 4 players max.

BlueMoonStories - 06/28/2017
For those involved with player abilities, you should also put together power sets and abilities for existing campers like Percy, Leo, etc. each camper should have at least one ability so that players have a reason to use them.
Pedro87 - 06/28/2017
Yes
I think these more seasoned campers should have higher levels
And I think they should be really useful on a mission
S P A C E D A D - 06/28/2017
@BlueMoonStories Can I begin to map out gameplay? Just the quick and dirty basics right now, just so we have an idea of what the coding team will need to do?
Pedro87 - 06/28/2017
That would be good
xIt's JJx - 06/28/2017
Just a question, which programming language is being used for animating?
Child of Hades - 06/28/2017
I'm not sure
there are lots of different programs we could use so we need to figure out which one we're using
I believe that blender 3D uses python
xIt's JJx - 06/28/2017
Ok thank you, I know quite a bit of Python
BlueMoonStories - 06/28/2017
yes, @S P A C E D A D
definitely start doing that
BlueMoonStories - 06/28/2017
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByxRF9RE9nJIUzlodzdwUFpHTmc/view?usp=sharing is a clip that is also in #voice-auditions but I was wondering how you guys thought it sounded as I'm trying to experiment with a potential Oracle voice. I used audacity, okay. This is not my normal voice lol disclaimer
June 29, 2017
BlueMoonStories - 06/29/2017
Here is the prophecy I recorded. Also edited in Audacity. I had to rearrange some of the lines to make it flow better, but let me know what you guys think! Subtitles will definitely  be neccesary though
Prophecy.mp3
242.69 KB
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByxRF9RE9nJIaWR6d2puc01Idnc is the google drive version
xIt's JJx - 06/29/2017
I think it sounds great
Just how I imagined the Oracle
BlueMoonStories - 06/29/2017
The problem is I like the first version better, but now I don't know how to replicate it lol
The second is too echoey I think
Pedro87 - 06/29/2017
It sounds really great
June 30, 2017
Edelgris - 06/30/2017
How big of a variety of weapons are we going to have?
Pedro87 - 06/30/2017
I think it will have a weapon customization
For the Hefesto's children
So
We are going to have a lot of weapons
Edelgris - 06/30/2017
I'll start on a list in "Player Abilities" then.
The player will stick with one weapon the whole game basically?
Pedro87 - 06/30/2017
Hmm
I don't think so
Edelgris - 06/30/2017
It's how it's done in the books though.
Pedro87 - 06/30/2017
Yeah
Well
I have to live now
But we can discuss this later
Edelgris - 06/30/2017
Bye
Child of Hades - 06/30/2017
On the topic of the weapons, I think the player should choose their weapon at camp. If they lose or break their weapon during a quest they have to try to get a new one. Other than that they keep one weapon the entire time.
Element - 06/30/2017
i feel like if you are a kid of hepheastus you can always make new and better weapons as you learn more skills in crafting
Edelgris - 06/30/2017
I think that you could have some customization of your weapon when you enter the weapon shack, although not as much as if one makes a weapon by oneself.
Child of Hades - 06/30/2017
Hepheastus kids should definitely be able to make their own weapons. As for others customization should be kept to a minimum
They just go to the weapons shed and choose from maybe ten items
Unless they know a Hepheastus kid who can him then up with an awesome customized weapon
Edelgris - 06/30/2017
Are we going to at all sorts of weapons from all over the world or focus mostly on the weapons that are represented in the books?(edited)
Element - 06/30/2017
lets start with the weapon represented in the books and maybe add some extra later on(edited)
Child of Hades - 06/30/2017
We at least need swords, daggers, spears, and bows/arrows
Edelgris - 06/30/2017
I've started to write some weapons down on the player abilities document.
Pedro87 - 06/30/2017
Good!
Edelgris - 06/30/2017
Are we having tab targeting?
Child of Hades - 06/30/2017
What's that?
Edelgris - 06/30/2017
It's when you click on a player or a NPC and then they are marked. If you're not using some sort of AoE you can only damage/heal the NPC you've clicked on, and with a ranged weapon it sort of auto-aims (given that you're standing somewhat in the right direction of the NPC). World of warcraft is an example on that. We could also have some sort of action-combat (I think it's called), where you need to use the ability directly on the NPC (most likely also aim) and you don't need to mark the NPC beforehand. More like overwatch for example (Although it isn't a RPG). I think we should go with action-combat.
Child of Hades - 06/30/2017
I'm not completely sure. Game mechanics isn't a skill of mine, but tab sounds better than action combat
Pedro87 - 06/30/2017
I prefer action combat
But itcan be the other too
My opinion
Child of Hades - 06/30/2017
We could always make a poll in gda
Pedro87 - 06/30/2017
Yes, we could
Child of Hades - 06/30/2017
I just made a poll
Pedro87 - 06/30/2017
Hmm
Tab targeting or action combat?
Child of Hades - 06/30/2017
Yes
S P A C E D A D - 06/30/2017
Well, this game is very ambitious right now as it is, and since we have only a few coders coding something like this will take years with this size team.
So whatever it is we'll just try our best
Pedro87 - 06/30/2017
We need more coders
Did you know someone?
S P A C E D A D - 06/30/2017
No. I wish I did.
It'll just be a long time to make it, especially since some of us have to learn the language
Pedro87 - 06/30/2017
Yeah
Well
It's just us for now
We have to do our best
Child of Hades - 06/30/2017
I'm still trying to find more coders. I've only gotten a few though
Pedro87 - 06/30/2017
Really??
Child of Hades - 06/30/2017
Yeah, it hasn't gone too well
Pedro87 - 06/30/2017
Let me guess
They want money?
Child of Hades - 06/30/2017
No, they just have their own projects
Pedro87 - 06/30/2017
Oh
Right
S P A C E D A D - 06/30/2017
Well the project is really big and it will take a lot of time out of their schedule. I'm not sure if I will even have time to code with school and sports
Pedro87 - 06/30/2017
Yeah
I know...
Only do your best for now
Ok?
S P A C E D A D - 06/30/2017
Of course
I'll get modelling when I'm home
Pedro87 - 06/30/2017
Great
S P A C E D A D - 06/30/2017
Finally getting around to sketching out

Where does the MC come from
Pedro87 - 06/30/2017
The MC?
S P A C E D A D - 06/30/2017
Main character
Pedro87 - 06/30/2017
Aaah ok
Hmm
I don't know...
S P A C E D A D - 06/30/2017
Missouri is kind of towards the middle of the two?
Pedro87 - 06/30/2017
Manhattan?
S P A C E D A D - 06/30/2017
Idk
BlueMoonStories - 06/30/2017
Yeah main character should be from New York. Maybe the player can choose between Brooklyn and Manhattan or something
Although then again maybe not. I think the player should be from Manhattan simply because the Egyptians have Brooklyn, I think
xIt's JJx - 06/30/2017
Yeah. Brooklyn and Boston have their own gods, so I think Manhattan is good
Pedro87 - 06/30/2017
Okay
