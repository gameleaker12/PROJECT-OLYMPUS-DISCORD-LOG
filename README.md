# PROJECT-OLYMPUS-DISCORD-LOG
I've stopped. I thought I was playing a funny prank on a person I'm having a dispute with, but people are upset. 

I've deleted the logs and I have nothing saved.

I also read about the email password. I swear, I did not do that.


And to Jack, the other person involved in the dispute, I hope we can talk this out.
